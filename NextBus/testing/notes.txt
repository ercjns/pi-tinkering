Bus Tracking:

Hit the text based server, for example:
http://pugetsound.onebusaway.org/where/text/stop.action?id=1_11200
returns the mobileweb results, which can be parsed relatively easily. Hit them once every 60 seconds? For the following stops:

Route 49:
U District: 11200
CBD: 

Route 8:
Seattle Center:

Route 545:
Redmond:


potentially also hit the API with the key "TEST" because that seems to be working, but they probably don't like that. ;)
